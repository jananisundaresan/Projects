</summary><id>https//travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burma-travel-advisory.html</id><published>2019-02-19T15:59:21.369Z</published><updated>2019-03-26T16:57:23.928Z</updated></entry><entry><title type="html">Worldwide Caution - Caution</title><link href="https//travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/worldwide-caution.html" /><category label="caution" /><summary type="html">&lt;p>This latest update to the Department of State’s Worldwide Caution provides U.S. citizens with general information regarding terrorist activities, political violence and criminal activity that transpire abroad, as well as specific recommendations on how to prepare for possible contingencies, receive information on breaking security events and ensure that travelers can be contacted in an emergency. This version replaces the Worldwide Caution dated July 2, 2018.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html">Travel Advisories&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and information pages on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html">travel.state.gov&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers are also urged to enroll in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(STEP) to receive security messages and to make it easier to locate you in an emergency. The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>1 (888) 407-4747&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>1 (202) 501-4444&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;from other countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture. In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot; targets, such as:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hotels, clubs and restaurants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>places of worship&lt;/li>
&lt;li>schools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>parks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shopping malls and markets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites&lt;/li>
&lt;li>public transportation systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>airports&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Travel to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe because of critical levels of kidnappings, hostage taking, suicide bombings, widespread military combat operations, landmines, and terrorist and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne, magnetic, or other improvised explosive devices (IEDs), suicide vests, and grenades. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist and insurgent groups continue planning and executing attacks in Afghanistan.&amp;nbsp; These attacks occur with little or no warning, and have targeted official Afghan and U.S. government convoys and facilities, local government buildings, foreign embassies, military installations, commercial entities, non-governmental organization (NGO) offices, hospitals, residential compounds, tourist locations, transportation hubs, public gatherings, markets and shopping areas, places of worship, restaurants, hotels, universities, airports, schools, gymnasiums, and other locations frequented by U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy's ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly outside of Kabul. Evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and the volatile security situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Afghanistan. &amp;nbsp;Unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the Department of State. &amp;nbsp;U.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from traveling to all locations in Kabul except the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities unless there is a compelling U.S. government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk. &amp;nbsp;Additional security measures are needed for any U.S. government employee travel and movement through Afghanistan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. &amp;nbsp;Consider signing a power of attorney.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Carry a communication device and, where possible, ride in armored vehicles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Notify a trusted person of your travel itinerary and contact information. Avoid discussing your movement plans in public where you can be overheard or with persons who do not have the need to know.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Obtain&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html">medical evacuation insurance&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;with a company that operates in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as an evacuation point.&lt;/li>

Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reconsider Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Areas near the Panguna mine in Bougainville due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>civil unrest.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Highlands region due to the&amp;nbsp;long-term effects of an &lt;b>earthquake&lt;/b> in February 2018, and &lt;b>civil unrest&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as gang-rape, carjacking, home invasions, kidnappings, and armed robberies, is common. Tensions between communal or clan groups may result in violence at any time without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel">Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and Prevention (CDC) released a Level 2 Travel Notice for Papua New Guinea regarding the recent outbreak of vaccine derived poliovirus in the Morobe Province. The CDC has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/polio-papua-new-guinea">additional information&lt;/a> and advice on the outbreak. Travelers who have received all the routine childhood polio vaccinations as well as a single booster dose of polio vaccine as an adult have essentially no risk of infection with this vaccine derived polio that is circulating in Papua New Guinea. Malaria, tuberculosis, zika, HIV and other infectious diseases are also present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure, and U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including Bougainville.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Avoid using local taxis or buses, known as public motor vehicles or PMVs.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Areas Near the Panguna Mine - Level 3: Reconsider Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Autonomous Government of Bougainville has designated areas near the mine as “no go zones&amp;quot; due to the risk of violence and civil unrest. Bougainville police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure, and U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization before traveling to areas of concern, including Bougainville.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violent crime – such as sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder – are common even during daylight hours and in tourist areas.

&lt;p>Do not travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Any areas within 150 km of Brazil’s land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b>. (Note: This does not apply to the Foz do Iguacu National Park or Pantanal National Park.) &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not use public buses in and around Recife due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b> (see additional information below). &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, communidades, and/or conglomerados), at any time of day due to &lt;b>crime&lt;/b> (see additional information below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brasilia’s administrative regions (commonly known as “satellite cities”) of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa during non-daylight hours due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b> (see additional information below).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Recife’s Pina Beach from Dona Benvinda de Farias Street to the Brasilia Teimosa neighborhood after dark due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>crime&lt;/b> (see additional information below).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, and carjacking, is common in urban areas, day and night. Gang activity and organized crime is widespread. Read the Safety and Security section on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Brazil.html">country information page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Brazil:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Be aware of your surroundings, especially when traveling to tourist locations and in crowded public venues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid walking on beaches after dark.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not display signs of wealth, such as wearing expensive watches or jewelry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid using an ATM in low-light or remote locations. Never let someone “shoulder surf” or assist you. Be aware that criminals often target ATMs and businesses in the early morning hours. If you use an ATM, select those located inside of secure facilities, such as an airport, hospital, bank, or government building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution at, or going to, major transportation centers or on public transportation, especially at night. Crime statistics indicate that passengers face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public, municipal bus transportation throughout Brazil. Consider avoiding the use of public, municipal buses, at any time of day, and especially at night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use increased caution when hiking in isolated areas, and in particular around the city of Rio de Janeiro’s Corcovado Mountain trails. Multiple violent robberies have occurred on the hiking trails leading to and from Cristo Redentor on Corcovado Mountain, which are not regularly patrolled by Brazilian law enforcement. &lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;b>International Borders&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to areas within 150 km of the international land borders with Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Paraguay without advance approval from security officials due to crime. Travel to the Foz do Iguacu National Park and Pantanal National Park is permitted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Public Transportation&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crime statistics and trends indicate that persons face an elevated risk of robbery or assault using public bus systems throughout Brazil. Consider avoiding the use of public, municipal buses in Brazil at any time of day, and especially at night. The U.S. Government recommends against personnel using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil, and prohibits personnel from using public buses in and around Recife.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Informal Housing Developments (commonly known as “Favelas”)&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not travel to informal housing developments (commonly referred to in Brazil as favelas, vilas, communidades, and/or conglomerados), even on a guided tour. Neither the tour companies nor the police can guarantee your safety when entering these communities. Even in these communities that the police or local governments deem safe, the situation can change quickly and without notice. In addition, exercise caution in areas surrounding these communities, as occasionally, inter-gang fighting and confrontations with police move beyond the confines of these communities. Except under limited circumstances and with advance approval, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to enter any informal housing developments in Brazil. Read the Safety and Security Section on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Brazil.html">country information page&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for further information regarding favelas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Without advance approval from security officials, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to travel to Brasilia’s Administrative Regions of Ceilandia, Santa Maria, Sao Sebastiao, and Paranoa between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. (non-daylight hours) due to crime.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed conflict is ongoing throughout the country and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups, and weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence. Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict in South Sudan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements in the city, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and must usually be conducted in groups of two or more during daylight hours. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read the Safety and Security section on the &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/south-sudan.htmll">country information page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you decide to travel to South Sudan:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Exercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba.&amp;nbsp; Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid travel along border areas.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations and public gatherings. Even events intended to be peaceful can become violent.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be aware that photography in public is strictly controlled and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public – including while inside a vehicle.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor local/international news and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ss.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/security-and-travel-information/">consular messages&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enroll your trip in the State Department's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://step.state.gov/step/">Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&amp;nbsp;(STEP)&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review your personal security plan and visit our page on &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html">Travel to High-Risk Areas&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share important documents, log-in information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.everplans.com/articles/checklist-documents-to-organize-and-share">Find a suggested list of such documents here&lt;/a>.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Erase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.&lt;br>

&lt;p>There is an ongoing risk of widespread, violent, and unpredictable demonstrations in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti.&amp;nbsp; Due to these demonstrations, on February 14, 2019, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Haiti.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Protests, tire burning, and road blockages are frequent and unpredictable. Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common, and incidents of kidnapping have occurred. &amp;nbsp;Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents, and emergency response, including ambulance service, is limited or non-existent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Travelers are sometimes targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. The U.S. Embassy requires its personnel to use official transportation to and from the airport, and it takes steps to detect surveillance and deter criminal attacks during these transports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens due to reduced staffing and security concerns. The Embassy discourages its personnel from walking in most neighborhoods. The Embassy prohibits its personnel from:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Visiting establishments after dark without secure, on-site parking;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using any kind of public transportation or taxis;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visiting banks and using ATMs;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Driving outside of Port-au-Prince at night;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Traveling anywhere between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visiting certain parts of the city at any time without prior approval and special security measures in place.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Haiti:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li> Avoid demonstrations. Do not attempt to drive through roadblocks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arrange airport transfers and hotels in advance, or have your host meet you upon arrival.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be careful about providing your destination address in Haiti. Do not provide personal information to unauthorized individuals located&amp;nbsp;in the immigration,&amp;nbsp;customs, or other&amp;nbsp;areas inside&amp;nbsp;or near&amp;nbsp;any airports in Haiti.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As you leave the airport, make sure you are not being followed. If you notice you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station immediately.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purchase travel insurance and medical evacuation insurance ahead of time.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;b>State of Jammu and Kashmir&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks and violent civil unrest are possible in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Avoid all travel to this state (with the exception of visits to the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh). Sporadic violence occurs particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating India and Pakistan, and in tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups, including bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets, occur occasionally in the northeast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur without special authorization from the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Central and East India&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maoist extremist groups, or “Naxalites,” are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. The Naxalites have conducted frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive special authorization from the U.S. consulate responsible for the area to be visited. U.S. officials traveling only to the capital cities in these states do not need prior authorization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping, arrest, and detention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans.

&lt;p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur frequently in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p>The U.S. government’s ability to provide routine and emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited. On October 18, 2018, the Department of State ordered the temporary suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah. The American Citizens Services (ACS) Section at the U.S. Embassy Baghdad will continue to provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Basrah.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of, or supporting designated terrorist organizations, is a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>West Bank:&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp; U.S. government travel throughout the West Bank is extremely limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terror attacks and violent clashes in the West Bank have resulted in the deaths and injury of U.S. citizens and others. During periods of unrest, the Government of Israel may restrict access to and within the West Bank, and some areas may be placed under curfew.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Gaza:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/b>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, controls security in Gaza. The security environment within Gaza and on its borders is dangerous and volatile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations occur on a frequent basis and may turn violent without warning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sporadic mortar or rocket fire and corresponding Israeli military responses may occur at any time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Restrictions on U.S. Government Employee Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>U.S. government personnel are prohibited from travel to Gaza and areas in close proximity to Gaza.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>U.S. government official travel into the West Bank is conducted only with enhanced security measures. U.S. government employees are largely restricted from most personal travel in the West Bank, though portions of the West Bank are occasionally authorized for personal travel, depending on the security environment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>U.S. government personnel take additional security precautions when visiting refugee camps and “seam areas” where Israelis and Palestinians are in proximity to each other, and which have historically been flashpoints for violence. For example, sites with significant religious meaning to multiple faiths can be subject to violent protests or security incidents with little or no warning, especially during or around significant religious holidays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The U.S. government occasionally restricts travel for its employees to Jerusalem’s Old City based on the security environment. U.S. government employees are prohibited from personal travel into Jerusalem’s Old City on Fridays during the Muslim month of Ramadan.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses and public bus terminals throughout all of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>U.S. government employees must observe additional security requirements if traveling for any reason to the following locations:&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within 7 miles of the Gaza demarcation line;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Within 1.5 miles of the Lebanon border;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>East of Route 98 in the Golan; and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Within 1.5 miles of the Egypt border along the Sinai (including all portions of Route 10 and portions of Route 12).&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Travelers should avoid Jordan's border with Syria and Iraq given the continued threat of cross-border violence, including the risk of terrorist attacks. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km of the Jordan-Syria border, except the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, or for official visits to refugee camps anywhere in Jordan. Personal travel by U.S. government employees to the border areas or refugee camps is not permitted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Protests&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both planned and impromptu protests may occur throughout Jordan. Avoid demonstrations and follow the guidance of local authorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in North Korea as it does not have diplomatic or consular relations with North Korea. Sweden serves as the protecting power for the United States in North Korea, providing limited emergency services.

&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

&lt;p>Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the border with Syria due to &lt;b>terrorism&lt;/b> &lt;b>and&lt;/b> &lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the border with Israel due to &lt;b>the potential for&lt;/b> &lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>refugee settlements due to &lt;b>the potential for&lt;/b> &lt;b>armed conflict&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens should reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas in Lebanon because of the threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, especially near Lebanon’s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should be aware of the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them. The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. The potential exists for death or injury in Lebanon because of the attacks and bombings perpetrated by terrorist groups. Terrorists may conduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lebanese government cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. citizens against sudden outbreaks of violence. Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning. Armed clashes have occurred along the Lebanese borders, in Beirut, and in refugee settlements. The Lebanese Armed Forces have been brought in to quell the violence in these situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Public demonstrations can occur with little warning and could become violent. You should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. Protesters have blocked major roads to gain publicity for their causes, including the primary road to the U.S. Embassy, and the primary road between downtown Beirut and Rafiq Hariri International Airport. Access to the airport may be cut off if the security situation deteriorates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings may have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Border with Syria – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since August 2014, deadly terror attacks have occurred in border towns along Lebanon’s border with Syria, as have episodic clashes between the Lebanese Army and Syrian-based violent extremist groups. A 2017 Lebanese Army offensive expelled ISIS militants from territory along Lebanon’s border with Syria. The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region. The U.S. Department of State also warns U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on flights that fly over Syria, which include some flights to Beirut.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Crime levels in Libya remain high, including the threat of kidnapping for ransom. Westerners and U.S. citizens have been targets of these crimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Libya. Violent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and extremist groups have made threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, hotels, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outbreaks of violence between competing armed groups can occur with little warning and have the potential to impact U.S. citizens. The capital, Tripoli, and other cities, such as Surman, Al-Jufra, Misrata, Ajdabiya, Benghazi, Sabha, and Dernah, have witnessed fighting among armed groups, as well as terrorist attacks. Hotels and airports frequented by Westerners have been caught in the crossfire. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary reasons, do not grant detainees access to a lawyer or legal process, and do not allow detainees to inform others of their status. U.S. citizens should carry proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but having these documents does not guarantee fair treatment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some international and national airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. The U.S. government is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya and prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency or routine assistance to U.S. citizens in Libya, as the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli suspended its operations in July 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Libya, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of State lifted the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members. The U.S. Embassy in Managua is open to the public and provides the full range of consular services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout Nicaragua, armed and violent uniformed police or civilians in plain clothes acting as police (“para-police”) continue to target anyone considered to be in opposition to the rule of President Ortega. The government and its affiliated armed groups have been reported to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily detain pro-democracy protestors, with credible claims of torture and disappearances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Systematically target opposition figures, including clergy, human rights advocates, and members of the press.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Seize private property.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily search personal phones and computers for anti-government content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arbitrarily detain certain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These police and para-police groups often cover their faces, sometimes operate in groups numbering in the hundreds, and use unmarked vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rallies and demonstrations in opposition to the rule of President Ortega have been declared unlawful, but nevertheless occur. Government forces, uniformed police, and para-police have attacked peaceful demonstrators leading to significant numbers of arrests, injuries, and deaths. Looting, vandalism, and arson often occur during unrest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Road blocks, including in Managua and other major cities, may appear and limit availability of food and fuel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Government hospitals are understaffed and may deny treatment to suspected protestors. Some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Ambulances have reportedly refused to respond or have been denied access to areas with individuals needing emergency care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as sexual assault and armed robbery, is common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil unrest and poor infrastructure in parts of the country limit the Embassy’s ability to assist U.S. citizens in emergencies. U.S. government personnel must avoid demonstrations and require special permission to travel beyond a three-hour drive from Managua. Additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel may be put in place at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to Nicaragua:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consider arrangements to depart the country quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensure your U.S. passport is valid and available for a quick departure from the country, if needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid demonstrations and restrict unnecessary travel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not attempt to drive through crowds, barricades, or road blocks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Maintain adequate supplies of food, cash, potable water, and fuel in case you need to shelter in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use caution when walking or driving at night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep a low profile.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, is common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting kidnappings and possible attacks in Niger. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Terrorists operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, Burkina Faso, and throughout northern Niger. Avoid travel to Niger’s border regions, particularly the Malian border area, Diffa region, and the Lake Chad region. Mali-based extremist groups have crossed the border and conducted multiple lethal attacks on Nigerien security forces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of the capital, Niamey, due to security concerns. Outside of Niamey, all U.S. Embassy personnel are required to travel only during daylight hours and in a minimum of a two-vehicle convoy accompanied by armed Nigerien government security escorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Pakistan. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and&amp;nbsp;government facilities.&amp;nbsp;Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past, and information suggests they continue to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terrorist attacks continue to happen across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KPK, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in hundreds of casualties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rebel groups operating in Yemen have fired missiles and rockets into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. &amp;nbsp;Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh’s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes.

&lt;p>&lt;b>Yemen Border – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violence in Yemen has spilled over into Saudi Arabia on a number of occasions. Rebel forces in Yemen fire artillery at Saudi border towns and launch cross-border attacks against Saudi military personnel. Civilians who are near the border with Yemen are at risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens within 50 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to this area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Presidential elections&lt;/b> in Senegal are scheduled for February 24, 2019. If no candidate wins a majority during the initial balloting, a second round will be held, either on March 10, March 17, or March 24, with March 17 the most likely date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tensions are typically heightened during campaign and election periods, and some election-related demonstrations and other activities have resulted in violence. &amp;nbsp;The Senegalese government may impose travel restrictions as the elections approaches, sometimes without notice, which may affect travel plans. &amp;nbsp;Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible road blocks throughout the country during the campaign period and election day itself. &amp;nbsp;Regular road travel between regions is prohibited on election days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed individuals have set up roadblocks and attacked travelers on roads south of The Gambia in the Casamance region of Senegal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Land mines from prior conflicts remain in the Casamance Region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in this area. U.S. government employees are prohibited from travelling on National Route 4 south of Ziguinchor, on Route 20 between Ziguinchor and Cap Skirring, and on unpaved roads without armed escorts.&amp;nbsp; U.S. government employees are also prohibited from travelling after dark.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violent crime, such as kidnapping and murder, is common throughout Somalia, including Puntland and Somaliland. Illegal roadblocks are also widespread.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of schools acting as “cultural rehabilitation” facilities are operating throughout Somalia with unknown licensing and oversight. Reports of physical abuse and people being held against their will in these facilities are common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p&gt;Terrorists continue to plot kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks in Somalia. They may conduct attacks with little or no warning, targeting airports and seaports, government buildings, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, and other areas where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, as well as government, military, and Western convoys.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pirates are active in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Somalia due to the lack of permanent consular presence in Somalia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Somalia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;i>&lt;/i>&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia and review the &lt;a href="http://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre/live-piracy-report">Live Piracy Report&lt;/a> published by the International Maritime Bureau.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>

&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. This plan should specify who you would contact first, and how they should share the information.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify key sources of possible assistance for you and your family in case of emergency, such as the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate, FBI, the State Department, your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends/family in the high-risk area.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be sure to appoint one family member to serve as the point of contact with hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and Members of Congress, if you are taken hostage or detained.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones, so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax)&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;/li>

Please read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do Not Travel to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Darfur region, Blue Nile state, and South Kordofan state due to &lt;b>crime, kidnapping,&lt;/b> and &lt;b>armed conflict.&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue to pose a threat in Sudan. Terrorist groups in Sudan may harm Westerners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. They may attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities, and areas frequented by Westerners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a national state of emergency in effect across Sudan, which gives security forces greater arrest and incarceration powers. Security forces have enhanced authority to detain and arrest anybody they deem to be undermining public order, including protestors or those suspected of supporting the protests. Arbitrary detentions, including of foreigners, have been reported across the country. Curfews and checkpoints on roads may be imposed with little or no warning. The Sudanese government does not recognize dual citizenship and is likely to consider U.S.-Sudanese dual citizens as Sudanese citizens only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Demonstrations, including anti-Western rallies, can occur with no warning. Demonstrations, both announced and unannounced, have occurred frequently throughout Sudan since December 19, 2018. Police and other security forces may respond to public demonstrations suddenly and with violence. Demonstrations are also common before and after Friday prayers. Foreigners could be targeted in reaction to national and international events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Sudan, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization from the Sudanese government to travel outside of Khartoum. The U.S. Embassy requires U.S. government personnel in Sudan to use armored vehicles for official travel. Family members under 21 years of age cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Sudan.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>The Darfur states, Blue Nile state, and Southern Kordofan state – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking, is particularly prevalent in the Darfur region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tensions remain high between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and opposition forces and violence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas that border South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state and parts of Blue Nile and South Kordofan states.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>No part of Syria is safe from violence. Kidnappings, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Syria. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, and the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A porous border with Iraq and long-standing border issues with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Israel have contributed to a complex security environment in Syria, compounded by a protracted violent conflict and influx of foreign fighters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Nusrah Front, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is an ongoing and increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. Citizens should consult&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/" adhocenable="false">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b>Northern Border Region – Level 3: Reconsider Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extremist groups have carried out attacks in adjacent areas of Burkina Faso. Attacks may occur with little or no warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in areas north and northeast of the city of Dapaong, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these areas.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>The Cities of Sokodé, Bafilo, and Mango – Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a history of violent demonstrations in Sokodé, Bafilo, and Mango, during which protesters and security force members have been injured and killed. Security forces, at times, have used excessive force to disperse crowds and arrest demonstrators. Police have used tear gas to disperse rallies, causing traffic disruptions in city centers and along National Route 1. Authorities have interrupted internet and cellular data services during past protests, making communication difficult and unpredictable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Read the entire Travel Advisory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On January 24, 2019, the Department ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. government employees and family members due to ongoing political instability. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is common. Political rallies and demonstrations occur, often with little notice. Demonstrations typically elicit a strong police and security force response that includes the use of tear gas, pepper spray, water cannons, and rubber bullets against participants and occasionally devolve into looting and vandalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are shortages of food, electricity, water, medicine, and medical supplies throughout much of Venezuela. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/health-infrastructure-breakdown-venezuela">Level 3 ‘Avoid Nonessential Travel’&lt;/a> notice on May 15, 2018 due to inadequate healthcare and the breakdown of the medical infrastructure in Venezuela.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consular access to detained U.S. citizens who also have Venezuelan nationality is severely restricted by the Venezuelan government and the U.S. Embassy may not receive access in these cases. Security forces have arbitrarily detained U.S. citizens for long periods. Venezuelan authorities may not notify the U.S. Embassy of the detention of a U.S. citizen, and consular access to detainees may be denied or severely delayed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue to plot and conduct attacks in Yemen. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting public sites, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Additionally, there is a continuing threat of kidnapping/detention by terrorists, criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations may be targeted for attack or kidnapping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Military conflict has caused significant destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities. This limits the availability of electricity, clean water, and medical care. This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yemen is home to the world's largest cholera outbreak, and the disease is present throughout the entire country. Due to the ongoing security situation, there is limited availability of food, electricity, water, medicine and medical supplies; adequate medical treatment is unavailable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No part of Yemen is immune to violence. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations in February 2015. The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Yemen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/">Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault, is common, even during the day and in tourist areas. Although the family islands are not crime-free, the vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence and Grand Bahama islands. U.S. government personnel are not permitted to visit the Sand Trap area in Nassau due to crime. Activities involving commercial recreational watercraft, including water tours, are not consistently regulated. Watercraft are often not maintained, and many companies do not have safety certifications to operate in The Bahamas. Jet-ski operators have been known to commit sexual assaults against tourists. &amp;nbsp;As a result, U.S. government personnel are not permitted to use jet-ski rentals on New Providence and Paradise Islands.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks and kidnappings in Burkina Faso and may conduct attacks anywhere with no warning. Targets could include hotels, restaurants, police stations, customs offices, areas at or near mining sites, military posts, and schools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in remote and rural areas of the country. &amp;nbsp;Due to the risk of attacks throughout Burkina Faso, the U.S. Embassy restricts official government travel to Ouagadougou’s Arrondissement 11, the Sahel and East regions, as well as the following provinces: Koulpelogo, Loroum, Yatenga, Sourou, Kossi, Banwa, Kenedougou and the area within 50km of the Mali border, in the province of Houet. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In December 2018, the Government of Burkina Faso declared a six-month state of emergency in the entire East and Sahel regions, the provinces of Kossi and Sourou in the Boucle de Mouhoun region, the province of Kenedougou in the Hauts Bassins region, the province of Loroum in the North region, and the province of Koulpelogo in the Center-East region.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Violent crimes, such as grenade attacks and armed robbery, are common.&amp;nbsp; Although Westerners are less likely to be specific targets, the risk related of “wrong time, wrong place” remains. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi, and there has been sporadic violence throughout the country, including frequent gunfire and grenade attacks. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict freedom of movement. &amp;nbsp;Police have searched the homes of private citizens as part of larger weapons searches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza are vulnerable to occasional cross-border raids by armed groups from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where violent clashes continue. The border may close without notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Burundi, and medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards. U.S. embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. These restrictions include limitations on travel outside of Bujumbura during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m.to 6:00 a.m.) and advance coordination for travel to the Bujumbura neighborhoods of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke, Gasenyi, Kamenge, Kinama, Musaga, Mutakura, and Ngagara.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Consider traveling in pairs and using convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the threat of roadside hoodlums when traveling outside of Bujumbura. Carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Include a satellite phone, map, navigation equipment, and first aid kit. Service stations are scarce in rural areas.

&lt;p>&lt;b>Phnom Penh&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Street crime, particularly phone and bag snatchings, occurs frequently in areas where foreigners gather; resistance can result in injury. We urge all travelers to be aware of their surroundings at all time and to be extra vigilant when displaying items like jewelry, bags and cell phones in public. Violent crime, such as sexual assault and homicide, is common, sometimes against foreigners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Use caution when walking or driving at night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap, Pailin, and Kampong Thom provinces&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Chinese authorities have asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving China by using ‘exit bans,’ sometimes keeping U.S. citizens in China for years. China uses exit bans coercively:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>to compel U.S. citizens to participate in Chinese government investigations,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to lure individuals back to China from abroad, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In most cases, U.S. citizens only become aware of the exit ban when they attempt to depart China, and there is no method to find out how long the ban may continue. U.S. citizens under exit bans have been harassed and threatened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>U.S. citizens may be detained without access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime. U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention for reasons related to “state security.” Security personnel may detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for sending private electronic messages critical of the Chinese government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extra security measures, such as security checks and increased levels of police presence, are common in the Xinjiang Uighur and Tibet Autonomous Regions. Authorities may impose curfews and travel restrictions on short notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>China does not recognize dual nationality. U.S.-Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment, and China may prevent the U.S. Embassy from providing consular services.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you decide to travel to China:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Enter China on your U.S. passport with a valid Chinese visa and keep it with you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or the nearest consulate immediately. &lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;b>South Ossetia and Abkhazia – Level 4: Do Not Travel&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Russian troops and border guards occupy both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The precise locations of administrative boundary lines are difficult to identify. Entering the occupied territories will likely result in your arrest, imprisonment, and/or&amp;nbsp;a fine. Violent&amp;nbsp;attacks and criminal incidents occur in the region. Landmines pose a danger to travelers near the boundary lines of both territories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Urban Areas – Level 2: &amp;nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime, such as street mugging, is more frequent in urban areas as compared to their surrounding suburbs. These crimes are also more prevalent at night and in isolated locations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens.&amp;nbsp; Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Intercity Highways – Level 2: &amp;nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Armed assaults on private vehicles and public transports occur more frequently after dark, often by criminal elements utilizing blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;b>Brong Ahafo, Northern, and Upper East Regions – Level 2: &amp;nbsp;Exercise Increased Caution&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil unrest due to chieftaincy disputes can occur at any time. While such disputes are typically non-violent, the likelihood for violence developing from a tribal dispute is greater in parts of these regions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Legislative elections in Guinea-Bissau are scheduled for March 10, 2019. The election date may be subject to change. The risk of violence is heightened during election periods, and in recent elections, some election-related demonstrations have resulted in violence. The Bissau-Guinean government may impose travel restrictions as the elections approach, sometimes without notice, which may affect travel plans. Expect additional police and military checkpoints and possible road blocks throughout the country during elections. Regular road travel is prohibited on election day, and stores will be closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Violent crime is common in Guinea-Bissau. Aggressive vendors, panhandlers, and occasionally criminals target foreigners at the Bissau airport and other crowded areas, especially Bandim Market in the center of the capital. Local police lack the resources, capacity, and training to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The country has been beset by chronic political and institutional dysfunction for decades, and there is the potential for violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens because there is no U.S. Embassy in Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p>
